To compile AtomicParsley on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0:

¥ admit that you are colluding with the evil empire by purchasing their products. Flog thyself often & repeatedly.

¥ install zlib
  zlib compression is optionally used in id3 tags on mpeg-4 files. Download the win32 zlib compiled dll (the last of the 4 listed) at http://www.zlib.net. Place the zlib123-dll folder inside the AtomicParsley/src/extras folder. Copy the zlib1.dll to your system32 directory.

¥ configure MSVC to use a local zlib
  From the Tools menu choose "Options" and select the "Directories" tab in the Options window.
  On the right it will say "Show directories for" and have "Include files" selected.
  On the lower portion, click on a new entry and locate the zlib include folder. It will be something like AtomicParsley/src/extras/zlib123-dll/includeÊ
  Switch from "Include files" to "Library Files" and create a new entry. The folder to add will be the lib folder - something like this: AtomicParsley/src/extras/zlib123-dll/libÊ
  Hit the ok button to close the options window.

¥ create a msvc project
  in MSVC choose File->New... & select "Win32 Console Application". Use the "Empty Project" setting. Name it something like AtomicParsley or "whatever".
  Select the tab on the left side 2/3 of the way down called "File View". Right click on the "Source Fies" section in the FileView tab. Add the *.cpp source files in AtomicParsley/src to the project. Also, add the *.c files in AtomicParsley/src/extras (the getopt sources).
  Right click on the "Header Files" section in the FileView tab. Add all the header files (*.h) in the AtomicParsley/src to the project. Also add the getopt.h header file in AtomicParsley/src/extras.

¥ enable zlib compression in AtomicParsley
  In the FileView tab, select the top level workspace (1 project).
  From the Project menu choose Settings. In the Link tab of that window, there is a spot labeled "C/C++". In the space labeled "Preprocessor definitions, add a comma, "HAVE_ZLIB_H" (without the quotes). It should look like this:Ê
WIN32,NDEBUG,_CONSOLE,_MBCS,HAVE_ZLIB_H
  Switch to the tab labeled "Object/Library modules". At the very end of this, add a space and "zdll.lib" (without the quotes). Hit the okay button.

¥ build AtomicParsley.exe
  From the Build menu, choose "Build whatever.exe".
  There will be dozens of warnings - those can be ignored.
